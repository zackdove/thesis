## Investigating the Viability of Fingerprinting the Toolset Used ToProbe an Operational Technology Network, ProvidingAnother Indicative Vector to Use in Intrusion Detection Systems.


## Abstract

In  this  work  we  investigated  the  viability  of  fingerprinting  asset  discovery  tools  usedto probe operational technology networks, in order to provide an additional vector to usein intrusion detection systems.  We collected packet captures from several scanning toolsused on a real PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), and then extracted different groupsof features from each packet capture, using this to build several different classifiers.  Weevaluated  these  classifiers  on  test  data  with  additional  noise  added,  achieving  an  exactmatch accuracy of 92% - 100%, showing that it is indeed possible to fingerprint the toolsetused to a high degree of accuracy.  We also discussed the viability of this technique beingused within an IDS (intrusion detection system).
